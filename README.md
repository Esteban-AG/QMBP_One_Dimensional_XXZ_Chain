# QMBP_One_Dimensional_XXZ_Chain
Exat diagonalization model of the XXZ chain using block diagonalization of th Hamiltonian


This is the (partial) answer to a homework project for the Computational Tools for Quantum Many Body Physics Course given at TUD by Prof. Jan Budich. The code has many flaws, but it intends to apply the exact diagonalizatin technique to the XXZ chain Hamiltonian while trying to take advantage of the dimension reduction offered by the block form of the hamiltonian where spin in z direction is conserved. The Sheet4 is the exercise sheet , and the QMBP_Excercise_4 is what was handed in, the rest is the code that was used, as well as the graphs produced.
